# CSCI-4502-5502-Final-Project
## What this is
For our final project in data mining, we used Python, numpy, and pandas to build user-user, item-user-based, and hybrid collaborative filtering systems to try and predict/recommend classes a student should take in college.
For detailed information, analysis, and results, refer to the full [Project Report](https://github.com/jahoon1998/CU-Boulder-CSCI-5502-Data-Mining-Final-Project/blob/master/Project%20Report.pdf).

## Data references
We gathered our data from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10237496/#sec020)
For more information on where these data were gathered from please look at the readme in our data folder referenced here:

## Results
Our models recorded incredibly high accuracy for user-user filtering. Because we had a large database of students and most classes were required we were able to achieve nearly 97% accuracy.
## How to replicate
Dependencies for Python:
- Pandas
- Numpy
Any notebook with python3 and these dependencies should be able to execute the code within the repo
